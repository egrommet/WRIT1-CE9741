# Analytics and Data Visualization for Journalism

[WRIT1-CE9741, Fall 2013](http://www.scps.nyu.edu/content/scps/academics/course_detail.html?id=WRIT1-CE9741&catalogId=20133)
NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies


## Course Description

Data-based journalism is increasingly important at all levels of news organizations. This course will introduce you to fundamental concepts and skills for gathering, analyzing, and visualizing data. It's also a hands-on class; you'll apply the techniques you learn each week to a semester-long data-reporting project. 


## Course Philosophy

__The hardest part is learning what to Google.__ That's a bit facetious. It's grounded, though, in the fact that there's an extraordinary wealth of resources available online but a sharp learning curve. We can't cover even a small fraction of this constantly growing field in just 10 weeks. So my goal with this class is to help you gain fundamental skills that will make it easier to learn the rest:

- How to __think about data__ like a programmer â€” and as a journalist.

- How to __understand common data formats__: CSV, XML, and JSON.

- How to __find__ preexisting datasets, and __assemble__ your own.

- How to do basic, yet fundamental, __analysis__ on data.

- How to translate your data and analyses into line charts, bar charts, histograms, and other useful (if unsexy) __visualizations__.


## Prerequisites

What is __required__:

- A basic comfort with computers, Web browsers, and spreadsheets

- An interest in journalism and accuracy

What is __not__ required:

- Any fancy spreadsheet skills

- Any particular programming knowledge

- Any particular background in journalism


## Course Materials

All assigned readings in this course are available online, for free. The required and optional readings for each class are noted in the course outline for each class. They're also grouped by category in the class bibliography, along with several non-free books, such as Edward Tufte's classics.

Class will take place in a computer lab equipped with Mac computers, so you don't need to bring a computer of your own. If you'd prefer to use your own computer, that should be fine, too.

## Academic Integrity

All students are expected to be honest and ethical in all academic work. This trust is shared among all members of the University community and is a core principle of higher education. Any breaches of this trust shall be taken seriously.  A hallmark of the educated student and good scholarship is the ability to acknowledge information derived from others. NYU-SCPS expects that a student will be scrupulous in crediting those sources that have contributed to the development of his or her ideas. Plagiarism is a form of academic dishonesty.


## Students with Disabilities 

New York University is committed to providing equal educational opportunity and participation for students with disabilities.  Any student who needs a reasonable accommodation based on a qualified disability is required to register with The Henry and Lucy Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD) for assistance.


## Instructor

Before that, I worked at Slate Magazine as a staff writer and interactive-graphics programmer. I enjoy people, generally, so please don't hesitate to get in touch with questions, anxieties, et cetera. The easiest way to reach me is via email: jsvine@gmail.com
