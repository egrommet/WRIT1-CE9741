## Week 7, November 13: Visualization, part II – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Pre-class reading

- [Accessible Data Visualization with Web Standards](http://alistapart.com/article/accessibledatavisualization), by Wilson Miner, 2008

### What we'll cover

- Building basic charts with HTML and CSS.
- Throwing in some JavaScript magic.
- Using basic JavaScript charting libraries.

### Post-class assignments

- Use HTML and CSS to build a bar chart for one of your long-term projects' datasets. Consider using JavaScript to automate the process of building the HTML elements. Don't forget to label your axes.
- Use JavaScript to add some interactivity to your bar chart: perhaps a "tooltip" or a button that toggles between two different views. Does this improve the visualization, or detract from it? (The answer will obviously depend on your particular project and data.)
