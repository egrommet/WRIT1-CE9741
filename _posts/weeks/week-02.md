### What we'll cover

- Overview of the types of basic analysis, from counting to correlations, you can do on almost any dataset.
- Analysis using spreadsheet software.
- Analysis using database software.

### Post-class assignments

- Much like last week, find a new dataset and interview it, taking notes. Then, using any of the techniques we learned in class, do some basic analysis on the data: maximums, minimums, counts, sums, averages, et cetera. Write about what you found, what worked, what didn't work, what conclusions you can draw, and any problems you encountered with the data.
