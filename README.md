This is a [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)-based repository for the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies course I'm teaching in the fall of 2013, "[Analytics and Data Visualization for Journalism](http://www.scps.nyu.edu/content/scps/academics/course_detail.html?id=WRIT1-CE9741&catalogId=20133)" (WRIT1-CE9741). It's still a work in progress, but feel free anyhow to submit issues and pull requests.

Outline:
